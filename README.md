## Description
This R file supports the analysis of road checkpoints in West Africa. We use K-functions to investigate whether events of political violence tend to cluster near checkpoints, or whether they are dispersed from them. 

The methodology used in this script builds on Russell, D. G., & Radil, S. M. (2022). Landscapes of control: The geography of counterinsurgency in the Sinai, Egypt. The Arab World Geographer, 25(2-3), 98-118.

In terms of data processing, this script provides an example of how to integrate R's sf library with older functionality from sp and spatstat.
